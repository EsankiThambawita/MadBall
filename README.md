# MadBall

The purpose of this project is to design and develop MadBall, a two-player mobile game in which players use moving bars to bounce a common ball to their opponent's side. The game has dynamic maps with obstacles, power-ups, and growing difficulty each time. The goal is to provide an engaging experience with smooth controls, eye-catching visuals, and exciting action.
